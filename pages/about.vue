              This is a pet project designed to make trying out new house customization options fun and easy.
               Normally you can find me working on the <a href="https://sun-haven.fandom.com/wiki/Sun_Haven_Wiki">Sun Haven Wiki</a>,
                but it doesn't allow for interactive setups like this website. Eventually I'd like to expand this to preview 
              other kinds of decorating, but those would be much more expansive additions. At least for viewing the customizations, 
              I hope you enjoy!
